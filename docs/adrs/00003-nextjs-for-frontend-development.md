# 3. Use of Next.js for Front-End Development

Date: 2024-03-23

## Context

This ADR outlines the decision on whether to adopt Next.js as the primary framework for front-end development within the project. 

## Decision

We will adopt Next.js as the primary framework for front-end development in this project.

## Alternatives Considered

Several alternative frameworks were considered:

- React with Custom Server-Side Rendering (SSR): This approach offers full control over the build process and server-side rendering. However, it requires more manual configuration and maintenance compared to Next.js.
- Vanilla Javascript: While offering the most flexibility, it lacks many features that Next.js provides out-of-the-box, such as routing, automatic code-splitting, and image optimization. 
- Frameworks (Gatsby, Nuxt.js): While these frameworks offer similar functionalities to Next.js, Next.js was chosen due to its popularity, large community, and extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries.

## Consequences

Benefits of using Next.js:

- Improved Performance: Next.js offers built-in features like automatic code-splitting, static site generation (SSG), and server-side rendering (SSR), resulting in faster page load times and improved SEO.
- Developer Experience: Next.js provides a convenient developer experience with features like hot reloading, automatic routing, and built-in data fetching capabilities.
- Large Community and Ecosystem:  Next.js has a large and active community, which translates to extensive documentation, tutorials, and readily available third-party libraries.

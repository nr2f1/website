## 8. Using Vitest for Unit Testing

Date: 2024-07-09

## Context

Our project requires a robust and efficient unit testing framework to ensure code quality and maintainability. We have evaluated Jest, a popular choice, but believe Vitest offers a compelling alternative.

## Decision

We recommend adopting Vitest as the primary unit testing framework for the following reasons:

- Testing Library Integration: Vitest offers seamless integration with the Testing Library suite, promoting a more idiomatic and developer-friendly testing experience.
- Performance: Vitest boasts superior performance to Jest, particularly in large test suites, leading to faster feedback loops and improved developer productivity.
- TypeScript Support: Vitest provides first-class support for TypeScript, including type safety and improved code completion within tests.
  -Dependency Footprint: Vitest has a smaller dependency footprint than Jest, potentially reducing bundle sizes and improving overall application performance.

## Consequences

We are adopting Vitest as our primary unit testing framework, which offers significant advantages in performance, developer experience, and TypeScript support. Proper documentation and community engagement can mitigate potential risks.

# 11. Apollo Client as GraphQL Client

Date: 2024-07-09

## Context

We are building a Next.js application that requires fetching data from a headless CMS, Contentful. To efficiently manage data fetching and caching, we are considering using Apollo Client.
Decision

## Decision

We will use Apollo Client in our Next.js project for fetching data from Contentful. This decision is based on the following factors:

- Data fetching and caching: Apollo Client provides a robust and flexible mechanism for fetching data from GraphQL APIs, which Contentful offers. Its caching capabilities can significantly improve performance and user experience, especially for frequently accessed data.
- State management: Apollo Client's state management features can simplify the process of managing data within our application, making it easier to keep components in sync and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- GraphQL integration: Contentful's GraphQL API is well-suited for use with Apollo Client, allowing us to query for specific data and leverage features like fragments and variables.
- Community and ecosystem: Apollo Client has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party tools that can aid in development and maintenance.

## Consequences

- Increased complexity: Introducing Apollo Client into our project will add a layer of complexity. We will need to learn and understand its concepts and best practices, which may require additional time and effort.
- Potential performance overhead: While Apollo Client can improve performance in many cases, there may be scenarios where its overhead can impact loading times. We will need to monitor performance and optimize as needed.
- Dependency management: Adding Apollo Client as a dependency will increase the overall size of our project and introduce potential compatibility issues. We will need to carefully manage dependencies and stay updated with the latest versions.

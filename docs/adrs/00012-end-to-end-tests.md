# 12. End-to-End Tests

Date: 2025-03-15

## Context

Our website requires comprehensive testing to ensure functionality works as expected across different browsers and platforms. Additionally, we must ensure our application is accessible to all users.

We need a reliable, maintainable approach to end-to-end testing that can:

- Test across multiple browsers
- Run in our CI/CD pipeline
- Provide consistent results
- Include accessibility testing

## Decision

We will adopt Playwright as our end-to-end testing framework and integrate Axe for accessibility testing within our Playwright test suite.

### Playwright Implementation

We will:

- Add Playwright to our development dependencies
- Create a dedicated `e2e` directory for test files
- Configure Playwright to test across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Integrate these tests into our CI/CD pipeline
- Generate test reports and artefacts for failed tests
- Integrate axe-playwright, which provides Axe integration with Playwright
- Create specific accessibility test suites that run Axe against key pages
- Define appropriate accessibility conformance levels (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Generate accessibility reports as part of the test pipeline
- Treat accessibility violations as test failures in the pipeline
- Test with various viewport sizes to ensure responsive accessibility

Playwright tests will cover critical user journeys and key functionality of the application.

## Consequences

- Improved test coverage with accurate browser testing
- Early detection of cross-browser compatibility issues
- Automated accessibility testing ensures compliance
- Visual test reports will help with debugging failures
- Ability to test UI components in isolation and complete application context
- Strong TypeScript support enhances maintainability

# Website assets

## Description

To keep the costs as low as possible, the website assets are stored in this NX project. This way, the assets are deployed to GitHub pages (https://nr2f1.github.io/website/) and can be used in the website.

## Development

Add assets to the `/public` folder and run `nx build website-assets` to build the assets. The assets are then available in the `dist/assets` folder.

## Deployment

Once you worked and merged your changes, the assets are automatically deployed to GitHub pages. The assets are available at https://nr2f1.github.io/website/.
